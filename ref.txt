gaussian blur -> grayscale -> vertical edges -> binarize the image using Otsuâ€™s Thresholding -> Closing Morphological Transformation -> 
finding contours(before that image should be morphed and binarize) -> find minimum rectangle area(area of number plate: 4500-30000) ->
clean_plate and ratioCheck method of class PlateFinder -> number plate is ready -> HSV format -> adaptive thresholding and find characters
-> bitwise not operation on ->
